    "Ans. A tuple is an ordered, immutable, and collection of elements of any type. Here are some of the characteristics of tuples in Python:\n",
    "Ordered: The elements in a tuple have a specific order, and the order is maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable: Once a tuple is created, the elements cannot be modified or changed. This makes tuples useful for representing data that should not change, such as dates, coordinate points, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collection of elements: Tuples can contain elements of any type, including other tuples, making them a versatile data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexable: The elements in a tuple can be accessed by their index, just like a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneous: The elements in a tuple can be of different data types, unlike lists that can only contain elements of the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, tuples are immutable. They are similar to lists in many ways, but unlike lists, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple after they have been created."
